# AI Games and Logic Solvers
Developed a collection of AI programs in python designed to play games and solve logical problems using principles from game theory, artificial intelligence and machine learning. This suite of projects showcases a wide range of AI techniques including search algorithms, constraint satisfaction, inference, and probabilistic modeling.

## Key Components:

## Checkers AI: 
Built an AI that plays optimal checkers moves

## PageRank Simulation: 
Implemented a simplified AI model of Google's PageRank to determine the importance of web pages.

## Knights and Knaves Solver: 
Created a logic inference engine to solve classic Knights and Knaves puzzles.

## Minesweeper AI: 
Designed an AI that strategically reveals cells using probabilistic reasoning and constraint satisfaction.

## Tic-Tac-Toe AI: 
Developed a perfect-play AI using the minimax algorithm for a turn-based zero-sum game.

## Crossword AI: 
Developed an AI capable of solving crossword puzzles using constraint satisfaction

## Nim: 
Built an AI that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning
